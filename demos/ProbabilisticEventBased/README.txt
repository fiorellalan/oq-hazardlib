Probabilistic Event-based Risk Demo

The demo consists of two parts: hazard and risk. The hazard and risk
calculations are defined in separate .ini files and were designed to be
run together to form a complete end-to-end demonstration of the workflow.

--Hazard--
Expected runtime: ~4 minutes
Outputs: Ground Motion Fields, Stochastic Event Sets

--Risk--
Expected runtime: ~3 minutes
Outputs: Loss Curves, Aggregate Loss Curves, Event Loss Tables, Loss Maps
